# Contributing

First of all, thank you for contributing, you are awesome!

Please take a moment to review this document in order to make the contribution process easy
and effective for everyone involved.

## Reporting an issue

1. Make sure you have the latest version of Yii2-user and see if the issue still exists.

2. Search for similar issues. It's possible somebody has encountered this bug already.

3. Provide information including: the version of PHP, Yii and Yii2-user, the type of
operating system and Web server, browser type and version.

4. Provide the error call stack if available. A screenshot to explain the issue is very welcome.

5. Describe the steps for reproducing the issue. It would be even better if you could provide code
to reproduce the issue.

## Requesting a feature

1. Search Issues for similar feature requests. It's possible somebody has
already asked for this feature or provided a pull request that we're still
discussing.

2. Provide a clear and detailed explanation of the feature you want and why
it's important to add. Keep in mind that we want features that will be useful
to the majority of users and not just a small subset.

3. If the feature is complex, consider writing some initial documentation for
it. If we do end up accepting the feature it will need to be documented and
this will also help us to understand it better ourselves.

4. Attempt a Pull Request. If you're at all able, start writing some code. If
you can write some code then that will speed the process along.

## Pull requests

1. Fork the repo.

2. Install module using git as described in installation guide.

3. Add a test for your change. Only refactoring and documentation changes
require no new tests. If you are adding functionality or fixing a bug, we need
a test!

4. Make the test pass.

5. Commit your changes. If your pull request fixes an issue specify it in the commit message.
Here's an example: `git commit -m "Close #42 – Fix ugly bug"`

6. Push to your fork and submit a pull request. Please provide us with some
explanation of why you made the changes you made. For new features make sure to
explain a standard use case to us.

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:

- Following Yii2 Core framework code style
- Including tests
- Writing the documentation
