Most of web applications provide a way for users to register, log in or reset their forgotten passwords. Rather than
re-implementing this on each application, you can use Yii2-user which is a flexible user management module for Yii2 that
handles common tasks such as registration, authentication and password retrieval. Current version includes following features:

* Registration with an optional confirmation per mail
* Registration via social networks
* Password retrieval
* Account and profile management
* Console commands
* User management interface

> **NOTE:** Module is in initial development. Anything may change at any time.
