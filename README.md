Most of web applications provide a way for users to register, log in or reset
their forgotten passwords. Rather than re-implementing this on each application,
you can use Yii2-user which is a flexible user management module for Yii2 that
handles common tasks such as registration, authentication and password retrieval.
The latest version includes following features:

* Registration with an optional confirmation per mail
* Registration via social networks
* Password recovery
* Account and profile management
* Console commands
* User management interface
* Ability to impersonate as another user given admin access is available

> **NOTE:** Module is in initial development. Anything may change at any time.
