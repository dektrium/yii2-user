Installation
============

This document will guide you through the process of installing Yii2-user using **composer**. Installation is a quick and
easy three-step process.

Step 1: Download Yii2-user using composer
-----------------------------------------

Either run

```
$ php composer.phar require dektrium/yii2-user "dev-master"
```

or add

```
"dektrium/yii2-user": "0.9.*@dev"
```

to the ```require``` section of your `composer.json` file.

Step 2: Configure your application
------------------------------------

> **NOTE:** Make sure that you don't have any `user` component configuration in your config files.

Add following lines to your main configuration file:

```php
'modules' => [
    'user' => [
        'class' => 'dektrium\user\Module',
    ],
],
```

Step 3: Update database schema
------------------------------

> **NOTE:** Make sure that you have properly configured **db** application component.

After you downloaded and configured Yii2-user, the last thing you need to do is updating your database schema by applying
the migrations:

```bash
$ php yii migrate/up --migrationPath=@vendor/dektrium/yii2-user/migrations
```
